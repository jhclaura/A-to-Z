Here are the place how my Nonsense Diary gets to you know, before it interprets you.



#{my first voice to script}
<div class="poem">
	Hi is everything alright<br>
	ok<br>
	I'm ready<br>
	so this is the diary about nonsense the main ideas.<br>
	You talk about yourself<br>
	about you all them that they hear all your missing something here and this website will turn your<br>
	description into another lie self nothing and unusual<br>
	so your life has a new meaning<br>
	that's the best idea<br>
	and<br>
	later on I will incorporate this into<br>
	why we are what we pretend to be company<br>
	that's not what it's what we alarm<br>
	no that's okay<br>
	this website<br>
	you decide if you feel it can you feel<br>
	hello<br>
	it is over<br>
</div>



#{about how you should talk to the diary}
<div class="poem">
	Test test<br>
	someone just open the door and close it<br>
	so rude<br>
	there's so many sucks<br>
	sound<br>
	I don't know if it will break or not<br>
	but I do love you speak to me slowly just like you sleep talk to your children now I said goodbye to do it so<br>
	you won't feel the rush you will choose your word<br>
	anorexia will talk to children<br>
	that just help them understand<br>
	yeah<br>
	just that easy<br>
	do you understand<br>
	hope these mountains to hurry understand what you are talking about you trying to see what anyone<br>
	and they will make your life better<br>
	that's it<br>
</div>
