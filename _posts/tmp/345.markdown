SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON DEBUGGING JEKYLL!!! I used Github page and Jekyll theme for thesis <a href="http://jhclaura.github.io/MASK">MASK</a>, but apparently I forgot them all? Debugging is like you jump into a black hole and lose the sense of time...

Here are some useful lists if you want to use Jekyll theme. It's actually not that difficult, just have to be careful about the path setting, eg. {{ "PATH/NAME" | prepend: site.baseurl }}. WTH is that right?
