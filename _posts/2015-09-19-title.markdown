SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON DEBUGGING JEKYLL!!! I used Github page and Jekyll theme for thesis <a href="http://jhclaura.github.io/MASK">MASK</a>, but apparently I forgot them all? Debugging is like you jump into a black hole and lose the sense of time...

Here are some useful lists if you want to use Jekyll theme.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Using Jekyll with Github Pages</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Free Jekyll themes</a></li>
</ul>

It's actually not that difficult, just have to be careful about the path setting, eg. <i>{ { PATH/NAME , prepend : site.baseurl } }</i>. WTH is that?
