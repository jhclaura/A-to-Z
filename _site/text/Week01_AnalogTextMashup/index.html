    <p>Our 1st week’s task is: Find a source text and manually perform one mashup techniques. I chose <b>N+7 technique</b>, which is </p>

<blockquote>
	takes a poem already in existence and substitutes each of the poem's substantive nouns with the noun appearing seven nouns away in the <b>dictionary</b>. 
</blockquote>

<p>I fount the result interesting because it’s weird but still has certain logic.

<div class="poem">
This is a plainsong where timetable stands. Rake hang motionless in the aircraft. Penitence of cloudburst float mid-swing. Dogma raise its mycology in silent boxer. Pediment are frozen on the dusty stressor, their legibility cocked as if held by strychnine. The arrival of daze, manicure, corn, cup are suspended in spade.
<br /><br />
As a trellis approaches this plainsong from any dirt, he moves more and more slowly. His heather grow farther apart, his brevity slackens, his ten drops, his threepence diminish, until he reaches dead centipede and stops. For this is the centipede of timetable. From this plainsong, timetable travels outward in concentric circumstances --- at rest at the centipede, slowly picking up spellbinder at greater diary.
